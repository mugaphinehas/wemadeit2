            <p>Follow these steps to successfully plant and cultivate maize. This guide covers preparation, planting, and post-planting care.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Choose a Suitable Site:</strong> Select a location with good sunlight, well-draining soil, and a pH between 5.5 and 7.0.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare the Land:</strong> Clear weeds and debris from the field. Loosen the soil by plowing or tilling to allow for proper root development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Apply Fertilizer:</strong> Add organic compost or nitrogen-rich fertilizer to the soil. Mix thoroughly to enrich the soil with nutrients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Planting the Seeds:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plant seeds in rows, spacing them 30–50 cm apart in each row.</li>
                        <li>Place seeds about 5 cm deep into the soil to ensure proper coverage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Watering:</strong> Water immediately after planting to moisten the soil. Maintain regular watering, ensuring the soil stays damp but not waterlogged.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weed Control:</strong> Remove weeds regularly to prevent competition for nutrients and sunlight. Mulching can also help control weed growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pest and Disease Control:</strong> Use natural pesticides or insecticides if needed, and monitor plants regularly for signs of disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Harvesting:</strong> Maize is ready for harvest when the husks are dry, and kernels are firm. This usually occurs 90–120 days after planting.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

          
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Select a Suitable Site:</strong> Choose a location with well-draining soil and access to full sunlight. Beans grow best in soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Soil:</strong> Remove any weeds and loosen the soil by tilling or digging. Adding compost or well-rotted manure can improve soil fertility.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Planting the Seeds:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Space rows 45–60 cm apart to give beans enough room to grow.</li>
                    <li>Plant seeds 2–5 cm deep and space them about 10–15 cm apart in each row.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Watering:</strong> Water the soil immediately after planting to ensure it is evenly moist. Beans need consistent moisture, but avoid waterlogging the soil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Supporting Growth:</strong> For pole beans, set up stakes, trellises, or a support structure, as they will need something to climb as they grow.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Weed Control:</strong> Regularly remove weeds around the plants to prevent competition for nutrients and water. Be cautious not to disturb the bean plants' shallow roots.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pest and Disease Management:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and beetles. Consider using natural pest control methods if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Harvesting:</strong> Beans are typically ready to harvest within 50–70 days. Pick them once they reach their full size but are still tender.
            </li>
        </ol>
